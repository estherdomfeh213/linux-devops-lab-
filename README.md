# Linux DevOps Lab

> A personal learning lab documenting my journey to becoming a **DevOps & Cloud Engineer** through practical Linux projects, automation scripts, and infrastructure deployments.

---

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of **hands-on Linux and DevOps projects** built as I advance from beginner to professional-level cloud engineer.  
Each folder includes:
- **Daily practice scripts**
- **Mini projects**
- **Automation experiments**
- **Documentation of key commands, configurations, and learnings**

These projects cover everything from Linux fundamentals to AWS cloud automation.

## Learning Goals

By completing this lab, I aim to:

✅ Master Linux for DevOps environments  
✅ Automate system administration with Bash scripting  
✅ Deploy and manage web servers (Nginx, Apache)  
✅ Secure systems using permissions, UFW, SSH keys, and fail2ban  
✅ Build and deploy containerized applications using Docker  
✅ Automate infrastructure provisioning with Terraform  
✅ Manage and monitor cloud resources using AWS CLI and CloudWatch  
✅ Implement CI/CD workflows with GitHub Actions
